			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Experiment with basic Javascript data types and variables. In this case 
						my partner and I had to create variables for the make, model, color, year,
						and age for our cars in javascript. We then had to link those variables to
						our HTML. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Not many issues arose in this lab as it was pretty straightforward
						However, linking the items to our HTML was a bit tough using the "Document
						.writeln". It was a bit confusing as to if we actually add our variables in. 
						However, we realized that if we didn't it worked!
