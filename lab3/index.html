			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>The Subject of this Lab</h2>
					<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>For this lab I had trouble with navigating the files and making sure everything is in the right place. 
						I also had trouble creating an unordered list and linking everything together. I am beginning to get
						the hang of it now.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here they are. You are looking at them!</p>
